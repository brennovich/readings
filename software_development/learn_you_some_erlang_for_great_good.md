# Learn You Some Erlang for Great Good

...

## Introduction

### So what's Erlang

Here are some highlights and interesting points:

- **Referencial Transparency:** Functions always returning the same result for the same parameter
- Obey its purest principles (functional programming's), but break away from them when real world problems pop up.
- Every communication is explicit, traceable and safe
- The standard distribution includes development tools, the Open Telecom Platform (OTP) Framework, a web server, a parser generator, and the mnesia database, a key-value storage system able to replicate itself on many servers, supporting nested transactions and letting you store any kind of Erlang data.
