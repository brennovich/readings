# Code Complete 2

I came across this book by a @ruianderson's indication, at the time I was looking for a technical book to read, and I wanted something with a pratical approach focused on things we do everyday as a Developer. Things like: low level design, testing, OOP, etc.

At the very beginning the book defines and exploit the term _Construction_ in every level, and even without a clear idea about this concept seemed, at the time, exactly what I was looking for.

## Part 1. Laying the Foundation

...

### Chapter 1. Welcome to Software Construction

OK, after talking so much about _Construction_ (and the book even started yet), nothing more fair than a wrap it up (Here are the topics listed by Steven, and what I understood about it):

> Verifying that the groundwork has been laid so that the construction can proceed successfully

  - Things like adding and configuring frameworks, libraries, technologies are takes as groundwork.

> Determining how your code will be tested

  - Dealing with testing integration with external dependencies, low level tests scopes.

> Designing and writing classes an routines
> Creating and naming variables and named constants
> Selecting control structures and organizing blocks statements
> Unit testing, integration testing, and debugging your own code

  - Cleary the coding process, as far as I can see this points are visited many times during the process.

> Reviewing other team members' low-level designs and code having them them reviewing yours.

  - Code Reviewâ„¢ :)

> Polishing code by carefully formatting and commenting it

  - Tricky, I would say that most of formating those days are done by linting tools, and about commenting it I read documenting it.

> Integrating software components that were created separately

  - Put thing to work.

> Tuning code to make it faster and use fewer resources

  - Finally care a bit about performance and optimizations.
