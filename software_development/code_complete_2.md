# Code Complete 2

I came across this book by a @ruianderson's indication, at the time I was looking for a technical book to read,
and I wanted something with a pratical approach focused on things we do everyday as a Developer. Things like:
low level design, testing, OOP, etc.

At the very beginning the book defines and exploit the term _Construction_ in every level, and even without
a clear idea about this concept seemed, at the time, exactly what I was looking for.
