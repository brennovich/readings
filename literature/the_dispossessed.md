# The Dispossessed: An Ambiguous Utopia

I love Sci-fi, but the first time my girlfriend talked about **The Left Hand of The Darkness**, also from [Ursula K. Le Guin](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ursula_K._Le_Guin), I didn’t feel attracted, probably I didn’t like the book cover :) You know what they say about books and their covers, I’ll spare you from that.

Anyway, the important thing is that when I decided to read the upper-mentioned book, I loved every detail. Ursula’s write style is awesome, the reader feels like everything is real. Because of that, **The Dispossessed** earned the priority in my book queue.

## Chapter 5

Here we’re back to nowadays and Shevek’s journey in Urras. In this particular moment he is dinning at Oiie’s house and his family

Things get really interesting when Oiie’s children starts to ask questions to Shevek.

**Note:** It’s so interesting how Ursula make us think about the most basic and granted values of our society.

The younger one says that Shevek doesn’t have good manners because he didn’t say “Thank you” when the young boy passed the dish of pickles. Shevek explains:

> I thought you were sharing them with me. Where they a gift? We say thank you only for gifts, in my country. We share other things without talking about it, you see.

## Chapter 6

Sometimes it's a bit hard to follow the chronology changing chapter by chapter, we're back to tweenies' Shevek still trying to figure out Simultaneity theory.

Shevek is having a very sentimental conversation with his old friend Bedap, and trying to explaing to him why he is stuck in his theory. There is a _renowned_ physicist which has power and influence in the Physics Federation, when Bedap try to open Shevek eyes:

**Bedap:**:

> The little men. Sabul's friends! The people in power.

**Shevek:**:

> What are you talking about, Dap? We have no power structure.

**Bedap:**:

> No? What makes Sabul so strong?

**Shevek:**:

> Not a power structure, a government. This isn't Urras, after all!

Then Bedap says very interesting things about ideas control (actually what made me written down this part)

> No. We have no government, no laws, all right. But as far as I can see, _ideas_ never were controlled by laws and governments [...]. You can't crush ideas by suppressing them. You can only crush ideas by ignoring them. By refusing to think, refusing to change.

**Shevek:**:

> Crazy talk, Dap.

**Bedap:**:

> No, brother, I'm sane. What drives people crazy is trying to live outside reality. Reality is terrible. It can kill you. Given time, it certainly will kill you. [...]. But it's the lies, the evasions of reality, that drive you crazy.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

OK, after reading this discussion between Bedap and Shevek (in the book there are a lot of interesting thing being said, I'm not going to transcript all of it, go read it) I have to say that is for the very nature of the human being to be selfish, to be protective to their power and advantages, sadly. When exposed to the smaller advantage one start to put this in the front of everything. It's like George Orwell shown in **[Animal Farm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_Farm)**, but here is even worst because Anarres was built with solidarity in mind since the Settlement, and people had no concepts of taking advantages, nor owning things, or whatever. It's like this selfish behaviour is very intrinsic into the human nature.

Bedad rise a point that may explain why people end to accept all of it:

**Bedap:**

> It's always easier not ot think for oneself. Find a nice safe hierarchy and settle in. Don't make changes, don't risk disapproval, don't upset your sundics. It's always easiest to let yourself be governed.
