# The Dispossessed: An Ambiguous Utopia

I love Sci-fi, but the first time my girlfriend talked about **The Left Hand of The Darkness**, also from [Ursula K. Le Guin](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ursula_K._Le_Guin), I didn’t feel attracted, probably I didn’t like the book cover :) You know what they say about books and their covers, I’ll spare you from that.

Anyway, the important thing is that when I decided to read the upper-mentioned book, I loved every detail. Ursula’s write style is awesome, the reader feels like everything is real. Because of that, **The Dispossessed** earned the priority in book queue.

## Chapter 5

Here we’re back to nowadays and Shevek’s journey in Urras. In this particular moment he is dinning at Oiie’s house and his family

Things get really interesting when Oiie’s children starts to ask questions to Shevek.

**Note:** It’s so interesting how Ursula make us think about the most basic and granted values of our society.

The younger one says that Shevek doesn’t have good manners because he didn’t say “Thank you” when the young boy passed the dish of pickles. Shevek explains:

> I thought you were sharing them with me. Where they a gift? We say thank you only for gifts, in my country. We share other things without talking about it, you see.
